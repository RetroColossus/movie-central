## Description: 
From the developers of Hobby Central comes the sister website: Movie Central. Similarly to developing hobbies, the video/film industry has been booming since we were quarantined in our homes. 

Movies/film, tv shows, streaming services, social media content, etc. have all increased in popularity due to the sheer amount of content available and simplicity of access. Families and friends binge on new and classic films on Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, HBO Max, Starz, Paramount+, Disney+, and many others in a seemingly endless list of apps designed to distribute this digital art. 

Movie Central is an online search engine that initially opens up with a current trending movie, followed by the search page to search using keywords to pull up movie results relevant to the user input query. Like Hobby Central, the capacity to personalize the experience is allowed through registering to create a new account and then being able to log favorite films, etc.
